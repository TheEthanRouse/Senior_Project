# Senior_Project
My senior project was more of a conglomerate of languages to create an end user dashboard for a CEO. The students were broken into four groups Sales and distribution, Production, and materials management, and the programmer. I was the head of the materials management team as well as the assistant to the programmer. We created a management dashboard on Visual Studio using Serene, most of the coding for serene was done in C#, java, and .net. Once I finished the materials management database for the dashboard the lead software developer and I hashed out the languages so that the dashboard would pull information from our databases. Each team had certain KPIs, key performance indicators, they were testing such as recyclability of a product in materials management. Depending on the change from these KPIs from the planned values and actual values received, then a KPI would end in 5 possible state of affairs: success, failure, conflict, crisis, and normal. All of these outcomes except success offered three knowledge processes which the CEO could choose from to fix the issue or improve the state of affairs.
